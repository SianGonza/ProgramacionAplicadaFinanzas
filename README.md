# Survival Finance with Python ðŸŽ©ðŸ’°
## Case Study: Hacking ARGENTINA

> This is a book aimed to learn python by applying real finance, by being a financial analyst in Argentina Economy (dealing with lack of information,
handling data errors and making things work)

You will get your hands dirty, there will be no Fabozzi/Hull/Allen,Brealey&Meyers theory cases in this book, 
I mean this case is tough, argentinian tough level to be honest, and all known books are perfect, but theoretically perfect
When you have to deal with outside US and be an emerging country your working scenario is blurry, to say it nicely.
